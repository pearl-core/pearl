Description
===========
**Pearl** is a package manager for dotfiles, plugins, programs
and any form of source code accessible via git.

As soon as a package is installed, its content can be activated out of the box
whenever a shell (i.e. Bash, Zsh or Fish) or editor (i.e. vim or emas) will be
started. This is possible via a smart and simple
[hook mechanism](#create-your-own-pearl-package-in-seconds)
that integrates the package content within the Pearl ecosystem.

The main advantages on using Pearl are:

- Create your own Pearl package ***in seconds*** (any git repository is alread a Pearl package)!
- Full control and sync of your dotfiles across different systems.
- No more hassles to use different package/plugin managers that only control specific editors, shells, etc.
- Automatic booting of the package content whenever shells or editors are started.
- Access to a wide range of existing packages via the [OPH (Official Pearl Hub)](https://github.com/pearl-hub).
- Allows to create your own package repository that can be shared with your friends!

Quickstart

Create your own Pearl package in seconds!
===============
**Any git repository is already a Pearl package**. For instance, in order
to see a dotfiles repository in Pearl, you just need to change
the Pearl configuration file located in *$HOME/.config/pearl/pearl.conf*.

Add the following line to *pearl.conf* file:

    PEARL_PACKAGES["joe-dotfiles"]="https://github.com/joe/mydotfiles.git"

In other words, update the `PEARL_PACKAGES` array with a new entry containing the
name of the package (i.e. *joe-dotfiles*) and the git url (i.e. *https://github.com/joe/mydotfiles.git*).

***That's it!*** The package will be ready to be installed, updated and removed via the Pearl system.

Also, an optional description of the package can be defined via `PEARL_PACKAGES_DESCR` array:

    PEARL_PACKAGES_DESCR["joe-dotfiles"]="The Joe's dotfiles"

## Structure of a Pearl package ##
Your own git repository can contain an **optional** directory
named *pearl-metadata* used by Pearl to integrate the package with the Pearl environment.

    / (package root)
    │
    ├── pearl-metadata (optional directory)
    │   │
    │   ├── install.sh
    │   ├── config.sh
    │   ├── config.bash
    │   ├── config.zsh
    │   ├── config.fish
    │   ├── config.vim
    │   └── config.el
    │
    └── (additional package content)

The metadata files are also **optional** scripts:

- *install.sh* - contains the [hooks functions](#hook-functions) executed during the *install*, *update* and *remove* events.
- *config.sh* - will be sourced whenever a new Bash/Zsh shell is starting up.
- *config.bash* - will be sourced whenever a new Bash shell is starting up.
- *config.zsh* - will be sourced whenever a new Zsh shell is starting up.
- *config.fish* - will be sourced whenever a new Fish shell is starting up.
- *config.vim* - will be executed whenever vim editor is starting up.
- *config.el* - (coming soon!) will be sourced whenever emacs editor is starting up.

The following variables can be used in any of the previous scripts:

- *PEARL_HOME*    - Pearl location (default: *$HOME/.config/pearl*)
- *PEARL_ROOT*    - Pearl script location
- *PEARL_PKGDIR*  - Pearl package location

Additionally, the scripts can use the utility functions in *utils.sh* that
make easier the integration with Pearl ecosystem.

Useful examples of Pearl packages can be checked in the
[Official Pearl Hub](https://github.com/pearl-hub).

### The install.sh script ###
#### Hook functions ####
- *post_install*  - Called *after* an installation of the package occurs.
- *pre_update*    - Called *before* an update of the package occurs.
- *post_update*   - Called *after* an update of the package occurs.
- *pre_remove*    - Called *before* a removal of the package occurs.
- *post_remove*   - Called *after* a removal of the package occurs.

#### An install.sh script example ####

    post_install() {
        info "Awesome - new package installed!"
        warn "Remember to setup your config located in: ~/.dotfiles"
        apply "source $PEARL_PKGDIR/mytmux.conf" ${HOME}/.tmux.conf
    }
    post_update() {
        post_install
    }
    pre_remove() {
        info "dotfiles package removed"
        unapply "source $PEARL_PKGDIR/mytmux.conf" ${HOME}/.tmux.conf
    }

The `info` and `warn` are functions that print a message
using different colors (namely white and yellow).

The `apply` `unapply` are idempotent functions (the result will not change
if the function will be called multiple times) that are able
to insert/remove a line in a config file.

All these functions belong to the *utils.sh* script.

## Use third-party project not available in Pearl Hub ##
If you want to use a third-party project
that is not available in the [Official Pearl Hub](https://github.com/pearl-hub),
you can:

* Point directly to the third-party project git repository
* Create your own git repository and use [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule)

### Point directly to the third-party project git repository ###
Let's suppose you want to install the [vim-rails](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails) plugin.
In your Pearl configuration (~/.config/pearl/pearl.conf), add your new Pearl package:

    PEARL_PACKAGES["vim-rails"]="https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails.git"
    PEARL_PACKAGES_DESCR["vim-rails"]="Ruby on Rails power tools"

Install the package:

    pearl install vim-rails

Voila', your new vim plugin is ready to be used!

This approach is particularly useful whenever you do not need to specify
any pearl metadata to *"enrich"* the third-party project inside
the Pearl environment.

### Create your own git repository and use git submodule ###
Inside your git repository, you just need to add the third-party project as a
[git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule).
For instance, to add the [powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline) in your Pearl package,
you can introduce a submodule in the *module* directory:

    git submodule add https://github.com/powerline/powerline.git module

The filesystem structure of the package will become something like this:

    / (package root)
    │
    ├── pearl-metadata (optional directory)
    ├── module/        (contains third-party code)
    └── (additional package content)

Then, you just need to modify the metadata scripts in order to integrate the third-party
project inside Pearl environment.

To see examples of Pearl packages from third-party projects take a look at the
[Official Pearl Hub](https://github.com/pearl-hub).

Create your own Pearl repository in seconds!
===============
A Pearl repository is just a git repository containing a file named *repo.conf*
with a list of packages. For instance, the *OPH* repository is available
[here](https://github.com/pearl-hub/repo).

In order to use the new repository (i.e. "https://github.com/myrepo/pearl-repo.git"),
update the *pearl.conf* file by adding the following line:

    PEARL_REPOS+=("https://github.com/myrepo/pearl-repo.git")
